FPGA Development Boards

Note: This is the standard 3-clause BSD license rephrased to reflect
hardware rather than software ("binary form" replaced with "board form"
and "this software" with "these designs"). This was done for the sake of
avoiding ambiguity because "binary" form for a circuit board is not well
defined.

The term "source" is used in this context to mean CAD files or other edititable
forms of a circuit board design. "Board form" means physical circuit boards,
lithography masks, Gerber files, and other intermediates in the manufacturing
process. The two categories combined are intended to encompass all possible
uses of these designs.
